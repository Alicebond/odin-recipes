    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Home made crunchy taco shells are excellent! Use home made tortillas, or
      corn tortillas from the store.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat about 1 inch of oil in a heavy skillet over medium to medium-high
        heat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use tongs to place one tortilla at a time into the oil. It should start
        to sizzle right away. Cook for about 15 seconds, then flip over and fold
        the shell in half, holding in place with the tongs until crispy, about
        15 seconds. You may need a little practice at first. Drain on paper
        towels, and sprinkle with salt while still hot. Use for tacos right
        away, or they may become chewy. Leftovers may be heated in the oven for
        crisping.
